## Smart Local Automations with AI

### Overview

This project aims to simplify the automation of local tasks by leveraging AI and messaging capabilities. Users can perform actions without needing to memorize complex commands; they simply describe what they want to achieve.

### Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Interact using plain language to specify tasks
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design that minimizes the learning curve
- **Multiple AI Models**: Support for different LLM models through profiles
- **Conversation Management**: Save, view, and manage conversations
- **Clipboard Integration**: Easy copy/paste functionality
- **Command History**: Access and reuse previous commands
- **HTML View**: View conversations in a browser
- **Profile System**: Switch between different AI configurations

### How It Works

1. **Input**: Users provide a description of the task they want to automate
2. **Processing**: The system interprets the input using AI to determine the appropriate action
3. **Execution**: The specified task is executed seamlessly
4. **Feedback**: Results are displayed in a user-friendly format
