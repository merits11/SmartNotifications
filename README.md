## Smart Local Automations with AI

### Overview
This project aims to simplify the automation of local tasks by leveraging AI and messaging capabilities. Users can perform actions without needing to memorize complex commands; they simply describe what they want to achieve.

### Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Interact using plain language to specify tasks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design that minimizes the learning curve.

### How It Works
1. **Input**: Users provide a description of the task they want to automate.
2. **Processing**: The system interprets the input using AI to determine the appropriate action.
3. **Execution**: The specified task is executed seamlessly.
